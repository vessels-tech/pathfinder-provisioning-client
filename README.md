## API

### Class: Client

This class represents a client to provision profiles in PathFinder.

#### createClient(options)

- `options` {Object}
  - `address` {String} The URI of the PathFinder provisioning server. Required value, no default provided.
  - `operation` {String} The SOAP operation for the message sent to PathFinder. Defaults to 'Request'.
  - `namespace` {String} The SOAP namespace for the message sent to PathFinder. Defaults to 'http://www.neustar.biz/sip_ix/prov'.
  
Creates a new provisioning client.

#### client.createProfile(profile)

Creates a profile in PathFinder. The profileId of the new profile must not match an existing profileId in PathFinder.

- `profile` {Profile} The profile to create.

Returns a Promise that resolves with a [`BaseResult`](#class-baseresult) object.

This method can also reject the returned Promise with a variety of `Error` types. See [PathFinder Errors](#pathfinder-errors) section for documented error types.

The Promise can also be rejected with validation errors:

- `NoProfileRecordsError` Thrown if the `profile` parameter does not contain any records.

#### client.updateProfile(profile)

Updates an existing profile in PathFinder. This method uses the profileId of the updated profile to match the existing profile in PathFinder.

- `profile` {Profile} The profile to update.

Returns a Promise that resolves with a [`BaseResult`](#class-baseresult) object.

This method can also reject the returned Promise with a variety of `Error` types. See [PathFinder Errors](#pathfinder-errors) section for documented error types returned from PathFinder.

The Promise can also be rejected with validation errors:

- `NoProfileRecordsError` Thrown if the `profile` parameter does not contain any records.

#### client.findProfile(profileId)

Finds a profile matching the provided profile ID.

- `profileId` {String} The profileId of the profile you wish to find in PathFinder.

Returns a Promises that resolves with a [`QueryProfileResult`](#class-queryprofileresult) object.

This method can also reject the returned Promise with a variety of `Error` types. See [PathFinder Errors](#pathfinder-errors) section for documented error types returned from PathFinder.

#### client.activatePhoneNumber(phone, profileId)

Associates a phone number with a profile in PathFinder. This will cause the profile's records to be returned when the phone number is queried in PathFinder. A phone number can only be associated with one profile at any given time.

- `phone` {String} The [E.164](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E.164) formatted phone number to act upon. The + sign at the beginning of the number is optional.
- `profileId` {String} The profileId of the profile you wish to associate with the phone number in PathFinder.

Returns a Promises that resolves with a [`BaseResult`](#class-baseresult) object.

This method can also reject the returned Promise with a variety of `Error` types. See [PathFinder Errors](#pathfinder-errors) section for documented error types returned from PathFinder. 

The Promise can also be rejected with validation errors:

- `InvalidPhoneNumberError` Thrown if the `phone` parameter is not a valid E164 formatted phone number.

#### client.deactivatePhoneNumber(phone)

Removes the association of a phone number with a profile in PathFinder. This will cause the profile's records to no longer be returned when the phone number is queried in PathFinder. A phone number can only be associated with one profile, so there is no need to specify the profileId with this method.

- `phone` {String} The [E.164](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E.164) formatted phone number to act upon. The + sign at the beginning of the number is optional.

Returns a Promises that resolves with a [`BaseResult`](#class-baseresult) object.

This method can also reject the returned Promise with a variety of `Error` types. See [PathFinder Errors](#pathfinder-errors) section for documented error types returned from PathFinder. 

The Promise can also be rejected with validation errors:

- `InvalidPhoneNumberError` Thrown if the `phone` parameter is not a valid E164 formatted phone number.

#### client.getProfileForPhoneNumber(phone)

Gets the associated profileId and other information for a phone number stored in PathFinder.

- `phone` {String} The [E.164](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E.164) formatted phone number to act upon. The + sign at the beginning of the number is optional.

Returns a Promises that resolves with a [`QueryNumberResult`](#class-querynumberresult) object. The data property will contain a single `QueryNumberData` record.

This method can also reject the returned Promise with a variety of `Error` types. See [PathFinder Errors](#pathfinder-errors) section for documented error types returned from PathFinder. 

The Promise can also be rejected with validation errors:

- `InvalidPhoneNumberError` Thrown if the `phone` parameter is not a valid E164 formatted phone number.

#### client.getActivatedPhoneNumbers(profileId)

Gets all of the associated phone numbers for a given profileId in PathFinder. It will only return phone numbers that are currently associated and have not been deactivated.

- `profileId` {String} The profileId you want to get associated phone numbers for.

Returns a Promises that resolves with a [`QueryNumberResult`](#class-querynumberresult) object. The data property will contain an array of `QueryNumberData` records.

This method can also reject the returned Promise with a variety of `Error` types. See [PathFinder Errors](#pathfinder-errors) section for documented error types returned from PathFinder.
